# Coding Example: Python Macro Project and R Supervised Learning Project

This repository contains two projects:  
1. A **Python project** demonstrating macroeconomic data analysis.  
2. An **R project** showcasing supervised learning models.

## Files

### Python Project:
- `Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing Python code and analysis steps.  
- `Python_Zou_data.xlsx`: The dataset used in the Python project.

### R Project:
- `Coding Example_R_supervised learning.qmd`: The Quarto Markdown file containing the R code and analysis for supervised learning.  
- Required data files:
  - `AQbench_dataset.csv`
  - `AQbench_variables.csv`
  - `water_potability.csv`

The 2 projects can be replicated by running the code having their repective files stored in the same working directory.
