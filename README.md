# Coding Example: Python Macro Project

This repository contains a Python project demonstrating macroeconomic data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis is based on the dataset `Python_Zou_data.xlsx`, which must be in the same directory as the notebook for proper execution.

## Files

- **`Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing Python code and analysis steps.
- **`Python_Zou_data.xlsx`**: The dataset used in this project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `openpyxl`

Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl

Getting Started

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-Macro-Project.git
cd Python-Macro-Project
Set Up Working Directory: Ensure both Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb and Python_Zou_data.xlsx are in the same directory.
Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory:
jupyter notebook
Open Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb.
Run the Code: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.
