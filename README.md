# Coding Example: Python Macro Project and R Supervised Learning Project

# This repository contains two projects: 
# 1. A Python project demonstrating macroeconomic data analysis.
# 2. An R project showcasing supervised learning models.

# FILES

# Python Project:
# - `Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing Python code and analysis steps.
# - `Python_Zou_data.xlsx`: The dataset used in the Python project.

# R Project:
# - `Coding Example_R_supervised learning.qmd`: The Quarto Markdown file containing the R code and analysis for supervised learning.

# PREREQUISITES

# For the Python Project:
# Python 3.x
# Required Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl

# For the R Project:
# R (version 4.0 or higher)
# RStudio or a Quarto-compatible editor
# Quarto (download from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
# Required R libraries:
Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "randomForest", "e1071", "quarto"))'

# GETTING STARTED

# Python Macro Project
# 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Example-Projects.git
cd Example-Projects

# 2. Ensure the working directory:
# Both `Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb` and `Python_Zou_data.xlsx` should be in the same directory.

# 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

# 4. In the browser, navigate to and open `Coding example_Python_Macro Project.ipynb`.

# 5. Run the code:
# Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially within the Jupyter Notebook interface.

# R Supervised Learning Project

# 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Example-Projects.git
cd Example-Projects

# 2. Ensure you have the following files:
# - `Coding Example_R_supervised learning.qmd`
# - Required data files:
#   - `AQbench_dataset.csv`
#   - `AQbench_variables.csv`
#   - `water_potability.csv`

# 3. Set up the directory structure:
mkdir data
mv AQbench_dataset.csv AQbench_variables.csv water_potability.csv data/

# Verify the structure:
# .
# ├── Coding Example_R_supervised learning.qmd
# ├── data/
# │   ├── AQbench_dataset.csv
# │   ├── AQbench_variables.csv
# │   └── water_potability.csv

# 4. Open the `.qmd` file in your preferred Quarto editor or RStudio.

# 5. Render the file using Quarto:
quarto render "Coding Example_R_supervised learning.qmd"

# Alternatively, interactively run the code chunks in RStudio.

# NOTES

# The R project includes tasks for data wrangling, regression modeling, and classification modeling.
# Ensure the data files are properly organized before running the R code.
